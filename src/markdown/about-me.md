I'm Alex Reis, a 23 years old <span>Backend Engineer</span> , from Aveiro, a city of Portugal!
<br><br>
Spending time learning about technology has been my passion since my parents gave me my first desktop.
At first, I was into gaming, like almost every young kid, but as years passed by, the interest relocated to other stuff like Photoshop, Blender, and Coding.

In high school, I attended the Economic area, but my head was only on my informatic passion. When I finished High School I decided that was time to follow my passion, and I applied for a sHigh Technical Degree in Software Development, a two year degree with integrated internship.
<br><br>
**I was fascinated! 🤯**
<br><br>
Since then, I'm always willing to learn more about this world and to complement this knowledge with online courses.

In July 2018, I signed my first contract and I was pretty excited about that time in my career.
<br>
I even attended a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering, which I am currently taking.
Behind this work and study environment, I consider myself a funny and relaxed guy wanting to fulfill his goals and to help others achieve theirs.
<br><br>
I love to learn new things and I'm always available to help others to solve problems! Thinking about new things, I'm currently learning game development! Isn't that amazing?
<br><br>
**Pleasure, that's me! 👋**
<br><br>
I consider myself a <span>funny</span> human being, <span>passionate</span>, <span>committed</span>, and also a <span>fast learner</span>!
