Spending time learning about technology has been my passion since my parents gave me my first desktop.<br>

At first, I was into gaming, like almost every young kid, but as years passed by, the interest relocated to other interests like <span>Photoshop, Blender, and Coding.</span>
In high school, I attended the Economic area, but my head was only on my informatic passion. When I finished High School I decided that was time to follow my passion, and I applied for a High Technical Degree in Software Development.
<br>
<b>I was fascinated!ðŸ¤¯</b>
<br>

Since then, I'm always willing to learn more about this world and to complement this knowledge with online courses. 
I even attended a Bachelor's Degree in <span>Computer Engineering</span>, which I am currently taking.
Behind this work and study environment, I consider myself a funny and relaxed guy wanting to fulfill his goals and to help others achieve theirs.
<br>

Pleasure, that's me! ðŸ‘‹
